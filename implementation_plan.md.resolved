# MitoPlate Improvement Plan

## Goal Description
Upgrade the existing "Mitochondrial Plate" mini-game to a premium, app-like experience. The goal is to enhance user engagement through better visuals (modern UI/UX), persistence (saving progress), and deeper educational value.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Design Direction**: I am proposing a "Premium Wellness" aesthetic. Soft gradients, rounded corners, glassmorphism effects, and refined typography.
> **Persistence**: Data will be saved to the browser's `localStorage`.
> **Single File**: I will keep it as a single HTML file for easy sharing/distribution, unless requested otherwise.

## Proposed Changes

### UI/Design Overhaul
-   **Color Palette**: update to a refined palette (e.g., soft teals, warm oranges for energy, clean whites/grays).
-   **Typography**: Use system UI fonts with better weight hierarchy (bold headers, readable body).
-   **Components**:
    -   **Cards**: Add subtle shadows, border-radius, and hover effects.
    -   **Inputs**: Custom styled range sliders and dropdowns.
    -   **Visuals**: Animate the Pie Chart changes (transition CSS).
    -   **Animations**: Fade-in effects for tabs and results.

### New Features
1.  **Auto-Save & Persistence**
    -   Save [Profile](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/mito-plate%202/MitoPlate/%D0%A2%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F%20%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9%208.html#1260-1293) data to `localStorage` immediately on change.
    -   Save current `Plate` state to `localStorage` so users don't lose progress on refresh.
2.  **History / Diary (New Tab)**
    -   Allow users to "Save" a plate to a history list.
    -   View past results (Date + Score + Summary).
3.  **Enhanced Copy/Share**
    -   Improve the text format for the "Copy Result" button.
    -   Add a "Share" button that formats a message for messengers (WhatsApp/Telegram).

### Code Structure
-   Refactor `script` to use a cleaner module pattern (even within one file).
-   Extract state management to a `Store` object that handles saving/loading.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
-   Since this is a single HTML file, mostly manual verification is needed.
-   I will use the browser tool to load the file and verify:
    -   Layout responsiveness (Desktop vs Mobile).
    -   Interactivity (Sliders update Pie Chart).
    -   Persistence (Refresh page -> Data remains).

### Manual Verification
1.  **Profile**: Enter data -> Refresh -> Check if data is there.
2.  **Game**: Move sliders -> Check Pie Chart updates.
3.  **Tabs**: Switch tabs -> Check content visibility.
4.  **Copy**: Click copy -> Paste into notepad -> Verify format.
